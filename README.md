## To set up and run a project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Git Repository: Clone the repository containing the project files using the git clone command. Replace <repository-url> with the actual URL of the Git repository.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/abcdeCoder/Frontend-Assignment.git
    ```
2. Install Dependencies: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using npm or yarn.
    ```
    cd 
    cd <project-directory>
    npm install
      or 
    cd <project-directory>
    yarn install
    ```

3. Start the Development Server: Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server using npm or yarn.
    ```
    npm start or yarn start
    ```

4. Access the Development Server: The development server will start at localhost on port 3000 by default. Open your web browser and navigate to ```http://localhost:3000 ```to access the project locally.
